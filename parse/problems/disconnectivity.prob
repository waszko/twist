Given:
  V E

Find:
  S

Satisfying:
  (* there is at least one vertex in the disconnected set S *)
  (exists x in V ( S(x)))
  &
  (* there is at least one vertex not in the disconnected set S *)
  (exists y in V (~S(y)))
  &
  (* all edges are either between nodes both in S, or both not in S *) 
  (forall w z in E ( (S(w) & S(z)) | (~S(w) & ~S(z)) ))
