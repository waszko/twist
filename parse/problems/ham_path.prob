Given:
  V E

Find: 
  T

Satisfying: 
  (* T is reflexive *)
  (forall x in V ( T(x x) ) )
  &
  (* T is transitive *)
  (forall x in V ( forall y in V ( forall z in V (
    (T(x y) & T(y z)) -> T(x z) ) ) ) )
  &
  (* T is antisymmetric *)
  (forall x in V ( forall y in V (
    (T(x y) & T(y x)) -> x=y ) ) )
  &
  (* T is a linear order on V if is RTA and: *)
  (forall x in V ( forall y in V (
    T(x y) | T(y x) ) ) )
  &
  (* y is successor of x in T implies there is an edge from x to y *)
  (forall x in V ( forall y in V (
    ( ~(x=y) & T(x y) &
      ~(exists z in V ( ~(z=x) & ~(z=y) & T(x z) & T(z y) )) ) ->
