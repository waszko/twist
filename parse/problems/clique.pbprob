Given:
  V E

Find:
  C

Satisfying:
  (* all vertices in the clique must be connected by an edge *)
  (forall x in V (
    forall y in V ( x=y |
      ( (C(x) & C(y)) -> (E(x y) | E(y x)) )
    )
  ) )
  &
  (* the size of the clique is at least equal to the input parameter K *)
  ( |C of V| >= K )
