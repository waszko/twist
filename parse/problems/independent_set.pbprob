Given:
  V E K

Find:
  I

Satisfying:
  (* if nodes a and b are both in the independent set I, then they must not
     be connected by any edge *) 
  (forall a in V ( forall b in V (
    ( I(a) & I(b) ) -> ~( E(a b) | E(b a) )
  )))
  &
  (* the size of the independent set is at least K *)
  (|I of V| >= K)
