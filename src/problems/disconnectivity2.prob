Given:
  V E

Find:
  S

Satisfying:
  (* there is at least one vertex in the disconnected set S *)
  (exists x in V (  S(x)))
  &
  (* there is at least one vertex not in the disconnected set S *)
  (exists y in V ( ~S(y)))
  &
  (* all edges are either between nodes both in S, or both not in S *) 
  (forall z in V ( forall w in V ( 
     ~ ( (S(z) & ~S(w)) & ( E(z w) | E(w z) ) )
  ) ) )
