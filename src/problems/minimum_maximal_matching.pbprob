Given:
  V E K
Find:
  M
Satisfying:
  (forall x y in E ( 
     (* no two edges in M share a common end point *)
     (M(x y) -> (forall a b in E ( ~(a=x & b=y) ->
        ( M(a b) -> (~a=x & ~a=y & ~b=x & ~b=y) ) ) ) )
     &
     (* edges not in M share an endpoint with some edge in M *)
     (~M(x y) -> (exists a b in E ( M(a b) & (x=a|x=b|y=a|y=b) )))
  ) )
  &
  (* the size of the set is at most K *)
  (|M of E| <= K)
